# Migration Cleanup for Production

This directory contains multiple development migration files that were created during the iterative development process. For production deployment, you have two options:

## Option 1: Fresh Production Deployment (Recommended)

For new production deployments, use only:
- `999_production_ready_schema.sql` - Complete consolidated schema

This single file contains:
- All table definitions with proper constraints
- Optimized indexes for performance
- Complete RLS policies for security
- Trigger functions for automation
- Sample data structure
- Validation functions

## Option 2: Existing Database Migration

If you have an existing database that went through the development migrations, you can:

1. **Verify current state:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM validate_guard_dog_schema();
   ```

2. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   pg_dump your_database > backup.sql
   ```

3. **Apply final fixes if needed:**
   Run only the latest migration files (014-016) that contain final RLS fixes.

## Development Migration History

The numbered migration files (001-016) represent the development journey:

- `001_initial_schema.sql` - Basic table structure
- `002_rls_policies.sql` - Initial RLS implementation
- `003_seed_data.sql` - Sample data for testing
- `004-005_*` - Foreign key constraint fixes
- `006-007_*` - Auth and user management fixes
- `008-012_*` - Data cleanup and role management
- `013-016_*` - RLS policy fixes and recursion prevention

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **For fresh deployment:**
   ```bash
   supabase migration up --to 999
   ```

2. **Verify deployment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM validate_guard_dog_schema();
   ```

3. **Expected output:**
   ```
   table_name  | rls_enabled | policy_count
   -----------+-------------+-------------
   classrooms | t           | 2
   profiles   | t           | 3
   progress   | t           | 2
   schools    | t           | 2
   students   | t           | 4
   ```

## Security Notes

- All tables have RLS enabled
- Policies follow principle of least privilege
- Service role has administrative access
- User roles are properly enforced
- No recursive policy dependencies

## Performance Optimizations

- Comprehensive indexing on foreign keys
- Query-optimized indexes on frequently filtered columns
- Efficient policy structures to minimize query overhead
- Proper constraint definitions for data integrity
